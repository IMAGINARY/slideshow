This is a bug fix update of Buddy API.

The following bugs were fixed:

Opening the Buddy Help file did not work on some XP systems.
baGetFolder did not set the initial directory correctly.
baEncryptText would sometimes not encode the last character correctly.
baTaskDialog did not set the correct lines for buttons 4 and 5.
calling baFileDateEx more than 256 times caused a crash.
baHideTaskbar did not hide the Start Button on Vista.
The CopyProgress functions did not show an animation when requested.
baSetDisplay and baSetDisplayEx did not return information when used in "test" mode.
The CopyProgress functions did not work on Director 11.5 when using the callback option.
The CopyProgress dialog would sometimes not close when copying from slow media and no files were found to copy.
Using baSetWindowState with baWinHandle() on a full screen projector used the stage instead of the background window.
